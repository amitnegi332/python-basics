        "A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning the server doesn't store client session information. They are popular for their simplicity, scalability, and interoperability."
